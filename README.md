# Love & Lions

Hi there! Welcome to Love & Lions, the ultimate way to show appreciation to your soulmate through tasks and rewards. Here's how it works:

## How It Works

1. **Create Tasks**: You can create tasks that your soulmate can complete. These tasks can be anything from helping with chores, planning a special date night, or simply doing something thoughtful. You get to decide what tasks are meaningful to you.

2. **Assign Lion Values**: Assign each task a lion value. Lions are our currency of appreciation. The more meaningful the task, the more lions it's worth. It's a fun way to express how much you value each task.

3. **Task Completion**: When your soulmate completes a task, they earn lions. They can see their progress and how much appreciation you're showering them with.

4. **Claim Rewards**: In return for the lions they've earned, your soulmate can claim rewards that you've set up. These rewards can be something they desire, like a night out, a thoughtful gift, or any other gesture of love.

5. **Show Appreciation**: Love & Lions is all about showing appreciation and gratitude. It's a unique and fun way to strengthen your bond and make your relationship even more special.
